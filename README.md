Interview
=========

1.  Write a program to open up the log file and read each line.  Keep track of the lines with an error response code of 400.  Output number found.

2.  Modify the  program to keep track of lines with response code of "4%%" or "5%%".   ("%" is the wildcard character.)

3.  Modify the 2nd program to keep track of lines with response code of 4%% or 5%%, and a user-agent string  "PSExpress" (either the whole user agent string or a prefix of the user agent).

4.  Extra credit, calculate time required to complete execution of any of the above programs.   Can the execution time be significantly improved?   Estimate savings, how would you do that?  Try it, report results.
